# NPU_controller_sim
This is a simulation project which works on Wenhao's NPU mainboard controller. The NPU module is using Zongze's synthesizable NPU module. 

3/19/21 NOTE:
  Zongze is now focusing on single BGA controller simulation. He will have frequent updates on NPU module and NPU single BGA controller TB. Most functions and tasks of the single BGA controller TB can be used in this sim project.
  Once Zongze finish his experience on single BGA experience, he will copy all his updates to this repo and make this mainboard controller simulation works.
